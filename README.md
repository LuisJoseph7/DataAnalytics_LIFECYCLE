# Supervised Learning Models – Default Probability Prediction

This project demonstrates the application of **supervised learning models** to predict the probability of default (credit risk). The goal is to compare different models, optimize their hyperparameters, and evaluate their performance using **AUC-ROC**.

## Project Highlights

- **Comparison by AUC-ROC**: Evaluate and compare model performance using the Area Under the ROC Curve metric.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Fine-tune models for better predictive accuracy using machine learning techniques.  

## Models Implemented

- **Random Forest** – Ensemble learning method for classification and regression.  
- **Logistic Regression** – Traditional statistical model for binary classification.  
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes** – Probabilistic classifier assuming Gaussian distributions.  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Maximizes the margin between classes for classification.  

## Workflow / Lifecycle

1. **Data Collection & Preparation** – Clean, encode, and scale features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyze feature distributions and correlations.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create and select variables that improve model performance.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** – Train models and evaluate using AUC-ROC.  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimize models for the best performance.  

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library for training and evaluation  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
