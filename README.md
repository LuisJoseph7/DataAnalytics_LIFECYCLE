# Machine Learning Project – Default Probability Prediction

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end machine learning workflow** for predicting default probability. It covers data collection, exploratory analysis, data preparation, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using various supervised learning algorithms.

---

## 1. Data Collection
Gathering relevant datasets from internal or public sources to prepare for analysis.

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**a) Univariate Analysis**  
- **Categorical Variables** – Frequency counts and visualizations.  
- **Continuous Variables** – Distribution, mean, median, standard deviation.  

**b) Bivariate Analysis**  
- **Categorical vs. Categorical** – Cross-tabulations and chi-square tests.  
- **Continuous vs. Categorical** – Boxplots, ANOVA, or t-tests.  
- **Continuous vs. Continuous** – Correlation analysis and scatterplots.  

**c) Multivariate Analysis**  
- Explore relationships among multiple variables simultaneously to identify patterns and dependencies.  

**Data Cleaning**  
- Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.

---

## 3. Data Preparation

**a) Data Scaling / Normalization**  
- **StandardScaler** – Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.  
- **MinMaxScaler** – Scale features to a given range, typically [0,1].  
- **RobustScaler** – Scale features using statistics that are robust to outliers.  

**b) Missing Data Imputation**  
- Handle missing values in strings and numeric columns using appropriate imputation techniques.  

**c) Categorical to Numeric Transformation**  
- Convert categorical variables to numerical representations for model compatibility.

---

## 4. Feature Engineering
- Create, transform, or select features that improve model performance and predictive power.

---

## 5. Model Building
- Train machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.  

---

## 6. Model Evaluation
- Assess model performance using metrics such as **AUC-ROC**, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Optimize hyperparameters to achieve the best predictive results.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms and tools  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
